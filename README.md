<p>Saipal  Store  has  recently  been  opened  in  the  heart  of  Tripureshwor.  Since  there  are  many departmental stores in the same area, the store has decided to offer a special discount on its opening day. The following table illustrates discounts based upon the different condition:
  </p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Purchase Amount</th>
    <th>Discount (%)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Less than 1000</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>More or equal to 1000 but less than 10000</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>More or equal to 10000 but less than 20000</td>
    <td>8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>More or equal to 20000 but less than 50000</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> More or equal to 50000</td>
    <td>15</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  The  shop  has  decided  to  develop  a  computer  program  <b>preferably  a  GUI</b>  based  application  that would read the details of the purchase made which include the information of <ins>Product Name</ins>, <ins>Rate</ins> and  <ins>Quantity</ins>  and  <b>the Amount  and the  Total  Amount  be  automatically  calculated</b>.<i>The  program should automatically calculate the discount amount and the amount to be paid by the customer.</i>
  </p>
